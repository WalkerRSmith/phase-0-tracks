# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
1. Version control allows a record of all changes to a repository and its files, as well as who made the changes. It also lets you save different versions of the file throughout editing.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of a project that allows you to add one thing at a time before merging the branches together. This helps when working with large or complicated projects.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a record of changes to a repository and a good commit message tells you what the change was in a clear and concise way.
* What is a merge conflict?
They usually occur when two people changed the same lines in the same file or someone decided to delete the file you are submitting a change for. Basically, git cannot tell which version of the project is the one it should use.
